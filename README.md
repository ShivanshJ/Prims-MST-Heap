# Prims-MST-Heap
Prims Algorithm for MST with reduced complexity using a Heap.
-------------------

Implementations of the following:
- Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm
- a library for the heap data structure

The use of the heap data structure gives Prim's algorithm an `O(ElogV)` running time, where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.

The code was tested on `Python 2.7.11`.
